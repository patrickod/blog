Despite the continued growth and evolution of the internet it has yet to really live up to its true potential as universally accessible communication, and the accessibility landscape of online content is no exception.</description></item><item><title>Making again</title><link>/2019/01/24/making-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/24/making-again/</guid><description>This is an extension of my last post: A brief musical journey, as well as a number of stories which I've been posting on Instagram in recent days.
As part of my of my adventures in the world of producing elecronic music I came across the fascinating world of modular synthesis. Modular synthesizers are composable musical instruments which are built up of many discrete modules, almost like the Lego bricks of synthesizers.</description></item><item><title>A brief musical journey</title><link>/2019/01/24/a-brief-musical-journey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/24/a-brief-musical-journey/</guid><description>I'm back! It's been a while but I've decided to dust off my old blog and to start trying to write some more regular updates as to what I've been doing these last 18 months. For those of you who I've not seen in a while it's been a busy time.
One of the primary things I've been spending time at recently has been all things music, in particular both learning to create and attending more live electronic music.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>/2016/10/23/hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2016 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/23/hugo/</guid><description>This weekend I took the opportunity of some downtime and the fact that I've deployed a new primary VPS (with the wonderful iocoop) to migrate my blog source to use hugo, leaving behind the Octopress setup I've had for a while.
Why? Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by spf13 such as cobra and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.</description></item><item><title>No more snowflakes</title><link>/2016/01/30/no-more-snowflakes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2016 15:17:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/01/30/no-more-snowflakes/</guid><description>Administrating a single server that's your sole responsibility isn't that much of a hassle but anyone who's shared this responsibility with others or inherited machines manually configured by others knows without documentation will quickly tell you it's a pain to work backwards from the finished server and maintain it going forward.
Getting bitten by this once or twice is OK, but as I get more involved in certain projects it's becoming a stronger anti-pattern, and so I'm making a pledge to stop it.</description></item><item><title>Running, reading, blue hair, and orbital mechanics</title><link>/2015/06/14/running-reading-blue-hair-and-orbital-mechanics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2015 15:18:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/06/14/running-reading-blue-hair-and-orbital-mechanics/</guid><description>I've lapsed yet again in the weekly writing requirement of the Iron Blogger project at Noisebridge and so feel compelled to give a core-dump type post to recount the happenings of the last two weeks.
I made a real breakthrough in my running in the last two weeks, after picking out some advice from /r/running on Reddit. I was absentmindedly browsing looking for training plans when I came upon a &amp;ldquo;beginners guide&amp;rdquo; of sorts which I scrolled though.</description></item><item><title>Rust barcode scanner v0.1, Freecon, and exercise</title><link>/2015/05/30/rust-barcode-scanner-v0-dot-1-freecon-and-exercise/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 15:16:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/30/rust-barcode-scanner-v0-dot-1-freecon-and-exercise/</guid><description>This week I finished the first version of the barcode scanning flow I've been working on for Noisebridge. It's a very simple Rust CLI that listens for input from a specified input device, and outputs only valid ISBN13 codes that it receives. Today I'll work on a small Go program to take the ISBN numbers, looks them up and records the books in a PostgreSQL database. The next step after that is a small web service which allows people to search the books and see what we have at Noisebridge.</description></item><item><title>Breaking radio silence</title><link>/2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 23:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/</guid><description>It's been a while since I've had the opportunity to sit down and write a nicely thought out blog post, but in the complete absence of any rhythm in recent postings I figured I'd write down some thoughts about the last 2 weeks.
I've been making slow (mostly due to time commitments), but good progress on the USB barcode scanner project I've been hacking on for Noisebridge. One of the frustrations in choosing Rust for this project was the lack of API stability in pre-1.</description></item><item><title>Linux Fest North West &amp;amp; Hackers on a Train recap</title><link>/2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 20:10:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/</guid><description>I've been neglecting my weekly blog post the last few weeks, but I'm back! The last few weeks and weekends have been busy with fun stuff.
The workshop I gave on Data Security for Journalists at the CPJ conference was really wonderful fun. It was great to meet Cyrus and Micah and hang out with them teaching journalists how to use security tools to protect both themselves and their sources. The workshop itself was a great success, with all attendees walking away with both a working knowledge and a suite of tools to help them in their daily work.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on teaching crypto to journalists</title><link>/2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 17:34:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/</guid><description>Last Saturday I gave a workshop on Data Security to a small group of Bay Area journalists at Noisebridge. The workshop was a small-group test of the same material that'll be used at a larger workshop I'm helping to lead at the Committe to Project Journalism's SF conference later this month.
Overall it was a great success and a really awesome experience, with 4 journalists walking away with a fully functional email encryption setup, as well as a good working knowledge on the concepts underpinning it.</description></item><item><title>Cycling bikes is fun</title><link>/2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 20:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/</guid><description>I started riding my bike to work the other day, and it's very enjoyable. I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.
I find it easy to fill time with non-exercise related things, so coupling exercise with my daily commute will hopefully facilitate this becoming a habit.</description></item><item><title>Anti-pattern checkin week #3</title><link>/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</guid><description>It's been 3 weeks since Noisebridge's Iron Blogger kicked off. While I'm happy to have kept myself to a schedule of writing at least once a week, I'm still trying to beat the anti-pattern of scrambling to write something last thing on a Sunday evening.
Thankfully, I have a few things I'm working on that I'd like to write about in more detail. I'm hoping to flesh out a few post stubs to keep on hand during the coming weeks such that I'll never be short of ideas about which to write.</description></item><item><title>Don't lock your data in proprietary products: Or, why I'm replacing my Drobo with a FreeNAS box</title><link>/2015/03/15/dont-lock-your-data-in-proprietary-products/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 21:47:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/15/dont-lock-your-data-in-proprietary-products/</guid><description>PSA: Don't trust your valued data to proprietary products. When they break you'll be up a proverbial creek without a paddle.
The Drobo FS honeymoon period Back in 2011 I bought a Drobo FS with the intention of using it as a home backup solution. The features it offered were exactly what I was looking for: some RAID-like setup promising single parity as well as a neat ability to setup network Time Machine shares.</description></item><item><title>Iron Blogger: It begins</title><link>/2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2015 22:59:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/</guid><description>I finally, this past weekend, got around to implementing the Iron Blogger group that I'd been hoping to start at Noisebridge before Christmas (better late than never). This post is actually the first of my weekly obligations. Watch this space for more blogging.
Things are going well. Life is busy on many fronts. The plans that I had for Linux Fest North West and, more specifically Hackers on a Train are coming along nicely.</description></item><item><title>Linux Fest North West - Hackers on a train</title><link>/2015/02/14/linux-fest-north-west-hackers-on-a-train/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 22:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/14/linux-fest-north-west-hackers-on-a-train/</guid><description>I realise it's been a while since I last posted. I've had some ideas for meaty blog posts but I've found them to be very difficult to shape into something I actually want to publish. The solution I think is to post more frequently about lighter material in a bid to get the hang of this blogging thing.
Just before Christmas, Torrie took a long train ride from Jack London Square in Oakland to Cleveland on her travels to 31c3.</description></item><item><title>2015: Resolutions</title><link>/2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 14:38:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/</guid><description>As I write this I'm back in Dublin having been at 31C3 these last few days. It was a fantastic time meeting a whole range of new interesting people, as well as getting to know better the wonderful friends that I've made this year.
Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that.</description></item><item><title>Reading mailing list archives with Python: Noisechain Pt. 1</title><link>/2014/11/23/reading-mailing-list-archives-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 23:12:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/11/23/reading-mailing-list-archives-with-python/</guid><description>Inspired by the twitter account &amp;ldquo;Shit Noisebridge says&amp;rdquo; I set about recently to script together that trains a Markov chaina on the complete archive of the noisebridge-discuss@ mailing list to create a rival account &amp;ldquo;Shit noisebridge probably says&amp;rdquo;.
It's not yet complete but one useful thing to have fallen out of this project already is a script that makes it easy to download mailman list arcihves in their entirety by passing the name of a list.</description></item></channel></rss>
