It's a very simple Rust CLI that listens for input from a specified input device, and outputs only valid ISBN13 codes that it receives. Today I'll work on a small Go program to take the ISBN numbers, looks them up and records the books in a PostgreSQL database. The next step after that is a small web service which allows people to search the books and see what we have at Noisebridge. <a href=../../../2015/05/30/rust-barcode-scanner-v0-dot-1-freecon-and-exercise/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/>Breaking radio silence</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

I've been making slow (mostly due to time commitments), but good progress on the USB barcode scanner project I've been hacking on for Noisebridge. One of the frustrations in choosing Rust for this project was the lack of API stability in pre-1. <a href=../../../2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/>Linux Fest North West &amp;amp; Hackers on a Train recap</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

The workshop I gave on Data Security for Journalists at the CPJ conference was really wonderful fun. It was great to meet Cyrus and Micah and hang out with them teaching journalists how to use security tools to protect both themselves and their sources. The workshop itself was a great success, with all attendees walking away with both a working knowledge and a suite of tools to help them in their daily work. <a href=../../../2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../post/page/2/>&lt; Prev</a>
