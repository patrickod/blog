#<a href=../../tags/noisebridge/>noisebridge</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Last Saturday I gave a workshop on Data Security to a small group of Bay Area journalists at Noisebridge. The workshop was a small-group test of the same material that'll be used at a larger workshop I'm helping to lead at the Committe to Project Journalism's SF conference later this month.
Overall it was a great success and a really awesome experience, with 4 journalists walking away with a fully functional email encryption setup, as well as a good working knowledge on the concepts underpinning it.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=../../2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=../../2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/>Cycling bikes is fun</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2015-03-25</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=../../tags/life/>life</a>&nbsp;

I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.
I find it easy to fill time with non-exercise related things, so coupling exercise with my daily commute will hopefully facilitate this becoming a habit.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=../../2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=../../2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/>Anti-pattern checkin week #3</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2015-03-22</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=../../tags/iron-blogger/>iron-blogger</a>&nbsp;

While I'm happy to have kept myself to a schedule of writing at least once a week, I'm still trying to beat the anti-pattern of scrambling to write something last thing on a Sunday evening.
Thankfully, I have a few things I'm working on that I'd like to write about in more detail. I'm hoping to flesh out a few post stubs to keep on hand during the coming weeks such that I'll never be short of ideas about which to write.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=../../2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=../../2015/03/15/dont-lock-your-data-in-proprietary-products/>Don't lock your data in proprietary products: Or, why I'm replacing my Drobo with a FreeNAS box</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2015-03-15</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=../../tags/data/>data</a>&nbsp;

The Drobo FS honeymoon period Back in 2011 I bought a Drobo FS with the intention of using it as a home backup solution. The features it offered were exactly what I was looking for: some RAID-like setup promising single parity as well as a neat ability to setup network Time Machine shares.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=../../2015/03/15/dont-lock-your-data-in-proprietary-products/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=../../2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/>Iron Blogger: It begins</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2015-03-08</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=../../tags/noisebridge/>noisebridge</a>&nbsp;

Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=../../2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=../../2014/11/23/reading-mailing-list-archives-with-python/>Reading mailing list archives with Python: Noisechain Pt. 1</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2014-11-23</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=../../tags/python/>python</a>&nbsp;
