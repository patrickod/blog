I've been making slow (mostly due to time commitments), but good progress on the USB barcode scanner project I've been hacking on for Noisebridge. One of the frustrations in choosing Rust for this project was the lack of API stability in pre-1. <a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/>Thoughts on teaching crypto to journalists</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2015-04-05>April 05, 2015</time></span></div><section class=summary>Last Saturday I gave a workshop on Data Security to a small group of Bay Area journalists at Noisebridge. The workshop was a small-group test of the same material that'll be used at a larger workshop I'm helping to lead at the Committe to Project Journalism's SF conference later this month.
Overall it was a great success and a really awesome experience, with 4 journalists walking away with a fully functional email encryption setup, as well as a good working knowledge on the concepts underpinning it. <a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/>Iron Blogger: It begins</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2015-03-08>March 08, 2015</time></span></div><section class=summary>I finally, this past weekend, got around to implementing the Iron Blogger group that I'd been hoping to start at Noisebridge before Christmas (better late than never). This post is actually the first of my weekly obligations. Watch this space for more blogging.
Things are going well. Life is busy on many fronts. The plans that I had for Linux Fest North West and, more specifically Hackers on a Train are coming along nicely. <a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><span class="nav-left faded">&lt; Prev</span>
