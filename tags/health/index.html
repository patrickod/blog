I made a real breakthrough in my running in the last two weeks, after picking out some advice from /r/running on Reddit. I was absentmindedly browsing looking for training plans when I came upon a &ldquo;beginners guide&rdquo; of sorts which I scrolled though. <a href=../../2015/06/14/running-reading-blue-hair-and-orbital-mechanics/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/>Cycling bikes is fun</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2015-03-25>March 25, 2015</time></span></div><section class=summary>I started riding my bike to work the other day, and it's very enjoyable.

It was a fantastic time meeting a whole range of new interesting people, as well as getting to know better the wonderful friends that I've made this year.
Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that. <a href=../../2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/>Read More...</a></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2019 slash blog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
