While I've long been a fan of taking a camera with me on trips, the months-long absences of any photos in my Lightroom library made me realize how much every day life I was neglecting to record.
As a byproduct of this new habit I've ended up with a bunch of material documenting in greater detail the electronics and musics side projects that have occupied more and more of my time since 2019.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>/2016/10/23/hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2016 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/23/hugo/</guid><description>This weekend I took the opportunity of some downtime and the fact that I've deployed a new primary VPS (with the wonderful iocoop) to migrate my blog source to use hugo, leaving behind the Octopress setup I've had for a while.
Why? Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by spf13 such as cobra and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
