It's been a while but I've decided to dust off my old blog and to start trying to write some more regular updates as to what I've been doing these last 18 months. For those of you who I've not seen in a while it's been a busy time.
One of the primary things I've been spending time at recently has been all things music, in particular both learning to create and attending more live electronic music.</description></item></channel></rss>
