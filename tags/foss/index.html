It's a very simple Rust CLI that listens for input from a specified input device, and outputs only valid ISBN13 codes that it receives. Today I'll work on a small Go program to take the ISBN numbers, looks them up and records the books in a PostgreSQL database. The next step after that is a small web service which allows people to search the books and see what we have at Noisebridge. <a href=../../2015/05/30/rust-barcode-scanner-v0-dot-1-freecon-and-exercise/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/>Linux Fest North West &amp;amp; Hackers on a Train recap</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

The workshop I gave on Data Security for Journalists at the CPJ conference was really wonderful fun. It was great to meet Cyrus and Micah and hang out with them teaching journalists how to use security tools to protect both themselves and their sources. The workshop itself was a great success, with all attendees walking away with both a working knowledge and a suite of tools to help them in their daily work. <a href=../../2015/04/26/linux-fest-north-west-and-hackers-on-a-train-recap/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/>2015: Resolutions</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

It was a fantastic time meeting a whole range of new interesting people, as well as getting to know better the wonderful friends that I've made this year.
Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that. <a href=../../2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/>Read More...</a></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2019 slash blog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
