I've been making slow (mostly due to time commitments), but good progress on the USB barcode scanner project I've been hacking on for Noisebridge. One of the frustrations in choosing Rust for this project was the lack of API stability in pre-1.</description></item><item><title>Cycling bikes is fun</title><link>https://d3j6ewz3bkzfsr.cloudfront.net/2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 20:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3j6ewz3bkzfsr.cloudfront.net/2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/</guid><description>I started riding my bike to work the other day, and it's very enjoyable. I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.
I find it easy to fill time with non-exercise related things, so coupling exercise with my daily commute will hopefully facilitate this becoming a habit.</description></item><item><title>2015: Resolutions</title><link>https://d3j6ewz3bkzfsr.cloudfront.net/2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 14:38:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3j6ewz3bkzfsr.cloudfront.net/2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/</guid><description>As I write this I'm back in Dublin having been at 31C3 these last few days. It was a fantastic time meeting a whole range of new interesting people, as well as getting to know better the wonderful friends that I've made this year.
Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that.</description></item></channel></rss>
