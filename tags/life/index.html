I've been making slow (mostly due to time commitments), but good progress on the USB barcode scanner project I've been hacking on for Noisebridge. One of the frustrations in choosing Rust for this project was the lack of API stability in pre-1. <a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/05/17/breaking-radio-silence/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/03/25/cycling-bikes-is-fun/>Cycling bikes is fun</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2015-03-25>March 25, 2015</time></span></div><section class=summary>I started riding my bike to work the other day, and it's very enjoyable. I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.

It was a fantastic time meeting a whole range of new interesting people, as well as getting to know better the wonderful friends that I've made this year.
Running into the end of the year I was feeling a little burnt out, mostly due to fire-fighting interpersonal drama in Noisebridge. I was very much looking forward to the break from SF and the commitments I have there in the hopes that I'd be re-energised, and as it turns out it has done exactly that. <a href=https://www.patrickod.com/2015/01/01/2015-resolutions/>Read More...</a></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2019 slash blog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
