I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.
I find it easy to fill time with non-exercise related things, so coupling exercise with my daily commute will hopefully facilitate this becoming a habit.</description></item></channel></rss>
