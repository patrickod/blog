While I've long been a fan of taking a camera with me on trips, the months-long absences of any photos in my Lightroom library made me realize how much every day life I was neglecting to record.
As a byproduct of this new habit I've ended up with a bunch of material documenting in greater detail the electronics and musics side projects that have occupied more and more of my time since 2019.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>/2016/10/23/hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2016 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/23/hugo/</guid><description>This weekend I took the opportunity of some downtime and the fact that I've deployed a new primary VPS (with the wonderful iocoop) to migrate my blog source to use hugo, leaving behind the Octopress setup I've had for a while.
Why? Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by spf13 such as cobra and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.</description></item><item><title>Anti-pattern checkin week #3</title><link>/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</guid><description>It's been 3 weeks since Noisebridge's Iron Blogger kicked off. While I'm happy to have kept myself to a schedule of writing at least once a week, I'm still trying to beat the anti-pattern of scrambling to write something last thing on a Sunday evening.
Thankfully, I have a few things I'm working on that I'd like to write about in more detail. I'm hoping to flesh out a few post stubs to keep on hand during the coming weeks such that I'll never be short of ideas about which to write.</description></item></channel></rss>
