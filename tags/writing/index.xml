Why? Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by spf13 such as cobra and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.</description></item><item><title>Anti-pattern checkin week #3</title><link>https://patrickod.com/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://patrickod.com/2015/03/22/anti-pattern-checkin-week-number-3/</guid><description>It's been 3 weeks since Noisebridge's Iron Blogger kicked off. While I'm happy to have kept myself to a schedule of writing at least once a week, I'm still trying to beat the anti-pattern of scrambling to write something last thing on a Sunday evening.
Thankfully, I have a few things I'm working on that I'd like to write about in more detail. I'm hoping to flesh out a few post stubs to keep on hand during the coming weeks such that I'll never be short of ideas about which to write.</description></item></channel></rss>
