While I'm happy to have kept myself to a schedule of writing at least once a week, I'm still trying to beat the anti-pattern of scrambling to write something last thing on a Sunday evening.
Thankfully, I have a few things I'm working on that I'd like to write about in more detail. I'm hoping to flesh out a few post stubs to keep on hand during the coming weeks such that I'll never be short of ideas about which to write.</description></item></channel></rss>
