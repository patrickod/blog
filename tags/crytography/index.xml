The workshop was a small-group test of the same material that'll be used at a larger workshop I'm helping to lead at the Committe to Project Journalism's SF conference later this month.
Overall it was a great success and a really awesome experience, with 4 journalists walking away with a fully functional email encryption setup, as well as a good working knowledge on the concepts underpinning it.</description></item></channel></rss>
