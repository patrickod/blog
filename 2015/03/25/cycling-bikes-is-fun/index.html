Usually with new changes like this I'm not very successful in consistently carving out the time to dedicate to it. Swapping out a MUNI ride for cycling is a perfect alternative.</p><p>The route to work is a real downhill joy in the morning, and it most definitely helps with waking up mentally. By the time I get to FIDI I feel ramped up for the day.</p><p>The homeward leg is relatively painless, the only difficult point being the last half mile from the panhandle up to my apartment on a hill. In hindsight a single gear might not always be the best option, but it's not all that much of a big deal.</p><p>I'm going to give this a few weeks and see how it goes. I'm cautiously optimistic that I can make this a productive, healthy habit.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=../../../../2015/04/05/thoughts-on-teaching-crypto-to-journalists/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
