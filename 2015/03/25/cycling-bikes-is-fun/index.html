I've been feeling a bit sedentary in recent times, so a more active morning and evening commute is a really welcome change. I'd kinda forgotten that nice feeling you get post-exercise, and it's made me realise that I should do this more often.</p><p>I find it easy to fill time with non-exercise related things, so coupling exercise with my daily commute will hopefully facilitate this becoming a habit. Usually with new changes like this I'm not very successful in consistently carving out the time to dedicate to it. Swapping out a MUNI ride for cycling is a perfect alternative.</p><p>The route to work is a real downhill joy in the morning, and it most definitely helps with waking up mentally. By the time I get to FIDI I feel ramped up for the day.</p><p>The homeward leg is relatively painless, the only difficult point being the last half mile from the panhandle up to my apartment on a hill. In hindsight a single gear might not always be the best option, but it's not all that much of a big deal.</p><p>I'm going to give this a few weeks and see how it goes. I'm cautiously optimistic that I can make this a productive, healthy habit.</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2019 slash blog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
