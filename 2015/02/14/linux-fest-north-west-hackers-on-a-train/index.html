On the way she continued to send me many beautiful photos of her train ride adventure, which made me envious to do a similar journey. She also mentioned her delight in being very productive on the journey, hacking many a thing as the train meandered amongst mountain ranges.</p><p>It got me thinking that I'd love to try and repeat her success, and create a small un-event called &ldquo;hackers on a train&rdquo;. The upcoming <a href=http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/2015>Linux Fest North West</a> conference in April I think might afford such an opportunity to make this happen.</p><p>The idea is simple: instead of taking a ~3 hour flight to Bellingham, WA to attend LFNW, organise a group to ride Amtrak the day before and hack a thing (tm) en route. At the time of writing I've not searched to see if this is a viable travel option, but I'm very hopeful that it will be. I'm excited at the possibility of making this idea a reality.</p><p>In other news: I've been working on a new <a href=https://donate.noisebridge.net>donations website</a> for <a href=https://noisebridge.net>Noisebridge</a> to help our upcoming fund-raising efforts (source available <a href=https://github.com/patrickod/noisebridge-donate>here</a>). I'm also helping put together a donation-matching fund to help the effort. Life is busy, life is good.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/2015/03/08/iron-blogger-it-begins/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
