Hey there. My name is Patrick O'Doherty. Originally from Dublin Ireland, I live in San Francisco's Inner Sunset with my wife [Ariane](https://twitter.com/STEMBiosis) and our wonderful rescue pupper Sophie seen below. I do computer security things for a living at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com). <img style="float: right; width: 25%; padding-left: 10px;" src="/images/about/sophie.jpg" alt="Sophie!"/> Fighting computers by day I also make music and tinker with DIY synthenizers at night. This blog hosts a smattering of some of the things that I'm working on. I hope you find it both entertaining and educational. 

You can find me on all the usual places on social media. Specifically I'm:
