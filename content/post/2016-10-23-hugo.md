This weekend I took the opportunity of some downtime and the fact that I've deployed a new primary VPS (with the wonderful [iocoop](https://iocoop.org)) to migrate my blog source to use [hugo](https://gohugo.io), leaving behind the Octopress setup I've had for a while.

Why? Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by [spf13](https://github.com/spf13) such as [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.

On top of that the Octopress setup I had never seemed to be very stable. Octopress itself has been in the middle of a major rewrite for quite some time, and combined with the hassle of bootstrapping the requisite Ruby runtime each time I started using a machine, the resulting hassle meant that my blog hasn't seen much use.

Hugo on the other hand is a) a single static binary which I can build easily on any of my development machines b) way more minimal in its configuration and c) much more functionaly complete. 

Thankfully hugo comes with an `import jekyll` command which allowed me to import the few blog posts that I'd already written. The only content left behind was the [about]("/about") page which is easily reproduced. 

Add in a [Makefile](https://github.com/patrickod/blog-hugo/tree/master/Makefile) to make generation and deployment an easy process, and the resulting blog code is much cleaner. 

I doubt this will be a major solo catalyst in promoting more writing on my par, but I do hope that it'll significantly reduce the activation energy that exists for me to publish anything.
