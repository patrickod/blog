The following is a list of some of the projects that I'm currently working on and about which I hope to write periodically on the blog.

 * [Eurorack Modular Synthesis](/tags/eurorack) (as written about in [making again](/2019-01-24-making-again/))
 * [SatNOGS ground station](https://wiki.satnogs.org/Intro) an open hardware/software satellite ground station 
 

You might also know me from such projects as:

 * [SunshineSF](https://sunshinesf.org) - a public resource to make San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance requests more accessible to all citizens.
 * [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net) - a hackerspace in San Francisco's Mission district
 * [Noisetor](https://noisetor.net) - a Tor exit relay and bridge operation housed within Noisebridge
