Well I've been on a small Go kick recently at $DAYJOB and elsewhere and having played with some of the other utilities developed by <a href=https://github.com/spf13>spf13</a> such as <a href=https://github.com/spf13/cobra>cobra</a> and admiring their ergonomics and simplicity I was keen to give hugo a try.</p><p>On top of that the Octopress setup I had never seemed to be very stable. Octopress itself has been in the middle of a major rewrite for quite some time, and combined with the hassle of bootstrapping the requisite Ruby runtime each time I started using a machine, the resulting hassle meant that my blog hasn't seen much use.</p><p>Hugo on the other hand is a) a single static binary which I can build easily on any of my development machines b) way more minimal in its configuration and c) much more functionaly complete.</p><p>Thankfully hugo comes with an <code>import jekyll</code> command which allowed me to import the few blog posts that I'd already written. The only content left behind was the <a href=%22/about%22>about</a> page which is easily reproduced.</p><p>Add in a <a href=https://github.com/patrickod/blog-hugo/tree/master/Makefile>Makefile</a> to make generation and deployment an easy process, and the resulting blog code is much cleaner.</p><p>I doubt this will be a major solo catalyst in promoting more writing on my par, but I do hope that it'll significantly reduce the activation energy that exists for me to publish anything.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=../../../../2019/01/24/a-brief-musical-journey/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
